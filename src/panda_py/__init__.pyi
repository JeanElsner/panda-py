that allows you to program and control the robot in real-time.

    """
    
      Connects to the control unit running the web-based Desk interface
      to manage the robot. Use this class to interact with the Desk
      from Python, e.g. if you use a headless setup. This interface
      supports common tasks such as unlocking the brakes, activating
      the FCI etc.
    
      Newer versions of the system software use role-based access
      management to allow only one user to be in control of the Desk
      at a time. The controlling user is authenticated using a token.
      The :py:class:`Desk` class saves those token in :py:obj:`TOKEN_PATH`
      and will use them when reconnecting to the Desk, retaking control.
      Without a token, control of a Desk can only be taken, if there is
      no active claim or the controlling user explicitly relinquishes control.
      If the controlling user's token is lost, a user can take control
      forcefully (cf. :py:func:`Desk.take_control`) but needs to confirm
      physical access to the robot by pressing the circle button on the
      robot's Pilot interface.
